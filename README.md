Gabi ng Lagim: Ang Manananggal sa Baryo Aswang is a Filipino multiplayer game inspired by a famous game made by Dimitry Davidoff did, in 1986, under the name "Mafia" which later on became "Werewolf."

This Filipino multiplayer game is where each player deceives the others while trying to hunt down the Manananggal and kill it before the innocent ones becomes food for the Manananggal. Can you survive the night?

How to play:
First, Assemble a group of players. There should be atleast 4 players to begin with. There should be 1 villager, one manghuhula, one policeman and one manananggal. 

The villager can only lynch who might be the Manananggal but can't identify nor kill it that is why policeman protects the villager and desperately wants to kill the Manananggal so that they live for another day. The Manananggal, in turn, wants to kill the villagers so that it can survive the game. It can pretend like a villager, policeman or manghuhula throughout the game just to kill so be careful. On the other hand, the Manghuhula can identify the characters of each player before the hunt begins. 

The system will be the moderator. It  makes the announcements of what's going on, to protect the identities of the characters. It will tally the votes,announce the victims, and make sure the game is played according to the rules. 

This game can be played on different devices given that the players should be playing under one server.


That's basically it! Enjoy, have fun but be careful!
